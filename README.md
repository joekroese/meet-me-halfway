## Meet Me Halfway

**Meet Me Halfway** is a website to help you meet your friends, family and clandestine lovers more easily, more often and for less money. Taking the dates of travel and the locations of you and your missed one, it returns the cheapest three places to meet and the price of the flights.

### Details

It uses the SkyScanner API with a python wrapper for the backend to read in flight information. We used Flask to create a front end user interface.
