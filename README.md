## Meet Me Halfway

**Meet Me Halfway** is a website to help you meet your friends, family and clandestine lovers more easily, more often and for less money. It finds the places that you could both fly to cheaply and gives you the cost.

### Details

It uses the SkyScanner API with a python wrapper for the backend to read in flight information. We used Flask to create a front end user interface.
